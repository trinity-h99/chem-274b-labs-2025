        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "From simple rules to complex systems, cellular automata (CA) represent a fascinating intersection of mathematics, computer science, and natural systems modeling. These deceptively simple systems demonstrate how complex behaviors can emerge from basic rules, making them powerful tools for understanding everything from biological growth to urban development.\n",
        "\n",
        "The concept of cellular automata emerged in the 1940s when John von Neumann, aiming to create self-replicating machines, developed the first mathematical model of a cellular automaton. However, it was John Conway's \"Game of Life,\" introduced in 1970, that truly popularized cellular automata. This simple two-dimensional system, with just two states (alive or dead) and a few basic rules, demonstrated how complex patterns and behaviors could emerge from simple rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "At their most basic level, cellular automata are mathematical models consisting of:\n",
        "1. A grid of cells (in one, two, or more dimensions)\n",
        "2. A finite set of possible states for each cell\n",
        "3. A set of rules governing how cells change states\n",
        "4. A neighborhood definition determining which cells influence each other\n",
        "\n",
        "Each cell in the grid updates its state based on its current state and the states of its neighboring cells, following predetermined rules. This process occurs in discrete time steps, creating a dynamic system that can exhibit remarkably complex behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Essential functionality for programmatic implementations include:\n",
        "1. An initialization or setup step\n",
        "2. A compute step\n",
        "3. An output and visualization step\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll see a few CA programs later on in this lab.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Fundamental Types and Examples\n",
        "\n",
        "### One-Dimensional Cellular Automata\n",
        "The simplest form of cellular automata exists in one dimension, often visualized as a line of cells that evolves over time. Stephen Wolfram's extensive study of these systems led to his classification of cellular automata into four classes:\n",
        "- Class 1: Evolution leads to a stable, uniform state\n",
        "- Class 2: Evolution leads to simple periodic patterns\n",
        "- Class 3: Evolution produces chaotic, random-looking patterns\n",
        "- Class 4: Evolution creates complex patterns with stable and moving structures\n",
        "\n",
        "### Two-Dimensional Cellular Automata\n",
        "Two-dimensional cellular automata, like Conway's Game of Life, operate on a grid where each cell interacts with its neighbors. Common neighborhood definitions include:\n",
        "- Von Neumann neighborhood: Four adjacent cells (north, south, east, west)\n",
        "- Moore neighborhood: Eight surrounding cells (including diagonals)\n",
        "- Extended neighborhoods: Larger patterns of influence\n",
        "\n",
        "![UN01](https://github.com/nrflynn2/swe-molecular-sciences/blob/main/figures/L04_UN01_Flynn.png?raw=1)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Mathematical Framework\n",
        "\n",
        "A cellular automaton produces a sequences of transformation states for all its cells based on a function that relates every cell’s current\n",
        "state, its neighborhood, and the time step.\n",
        "\n",
        "The mathematical description of cellular automata involves:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **State Space**: The set of all possible states a cell can occupy\n",
        "   $S = {s₁, s₂, ..., sₖ}$\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Transition Function**: A rule that determines the next state of a cell\n",
        "   $f: Sⁿ → S$\n",
        "   where n is the number of cells in the neighborhood. Cellular automata changes its states based on inputs and its previous states.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Global Configuration**: The state of all cells at a given time\n",
        "   $C(t): Z^d → S$\n",
        "   where d is the dimension of the automaton\n",
        "\n",
        "## Practical Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "When implementing cellular automata, several considerations are important:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Boundary Conditions**\n",
        "   - No boundaries (infinite space)\n",
        "   - Periodic (1D ring or 2D torus)\n",
        "   - Fixed boundaries (walled)\n",
        "   - Cut-off boundaries (no neighbors at the ends)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Performance Optimization**\n",
        "   - Parallel processing\n",
        "   - Efficient data structures\n",
        "   - GPU acceleration\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Visualization Techniques**\n",
        "   - Real-time rendering\n",
        "   - State color mapping\n",
        "   - Pattern detection\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, we have to consider variations in the input or setup steps:\n",
        "   - Setup a $n \\times m$ grid, where $1 \\leq n, m \\leq MAXSIZE$\n",
        "   - Cellular automaton can be sequential or parallel distributed\n",
        "   - User needs to specify boundary conditions\n",
        "   - User needs to specify states for the variables\n",
        "   - User needs to specify initial configuration for the cellular automaton\n",
        "   - User needs to specify rules\n",
        "     - Rules are expressed through state transition functions\n",
