        "\n",
        "### Background\n",
        "In structure-based drug discovery, virtual screening generates thousands to millions of predicted protein-ligand binding poses. Each pose is characterized by multiple parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Binding Energy (ΔG)**: Estimated free energy of binding in kcal/mol (more negative = stronger binding)\n",
        "- **RMSD**: Root-mean-square deviation from optimal geometry in Ångströms (lower = better pose quality)\n",
        "- **Hydrogen Bonds**: Number of H-bonds formed with the target (more = better specificity)\n",
        "- **Buried Surface Area (BSA)**: Contact surface in Ų (larger = more extensive interaction)\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Challenge\n",
        "Simple ranking by binding energy alone often misses promising compounds because:\n",
        "1. Scoring functions have inherent errors (~2 kcal/mol)\n",
        "2. Enthalpic contributions (H-bonds) may outweigh entropic penalties\n",
        "3. Pose quality (RMSD) affects reliability of predictions\n",
        "\n",
        "### Pareto Optimization Approach\n",
        "We implement multi-parameter optimization using a weighted scoring function that balances all parameters. While production systems use O(n log n) sorting for millions of compounds, selection sort's O(n²) complexity is acceptable for teaching the importance of multi-objective optimization.\n",

        "If curious to learn more about pareto frontier, see https://www.mayerowitz.io/blog/mario-meets-pareto\n",

        "### Implementation\n",
        "The code below demonstrates:\n",
        "1. Selection sort implementation with custom comparison keys\n",
        "2. Single-parameter ranking (binding energy only)\n",
